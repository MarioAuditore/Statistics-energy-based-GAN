[Project report](https://github.com/MarioAuditore/Statistics-energy-based-GAN/blob/main/ProjectReport.pdf) contains main details, theory and describes experiments we made. Also, it contains links to gif animations, which are also uploaded on github [here](https://github.com/MarioAuditore/Statistics-energy-based-GAN/tree/main/images).
